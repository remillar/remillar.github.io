		<h1>Snowsport Scotland</h1>
		<h2>Scottish Indoor Freestyle Championships 2014</h2>

		<p>The idea behind the SISC 2014 poster was to simplify and modernise. The background image is snow being sprayed by a skiier or snowboarder to remind the possible entrants of the slopes when in actual fact they will be performing in a huge fridge.</p>

		<h2>LASS Season 2013/14</h2>

		<p>LASS is the Snowsport Scotland initiative established to encourage girls and women to become actively involved in the Scottish snowsports scene. The aim is to get as many girls out there as possible during their weekends at the Cairngorm mountain in the Scottish Highlands. In 2014, LASS emerged from its pilot year hoping to become bigger and better.</p>

		<p>They needed something fresh and eye-catching. They needed something with a feminine feel but didnâ€™t seem too girly. They needed something to make people excited about getting involved and most importantly: having as much fun as possible.</p>
