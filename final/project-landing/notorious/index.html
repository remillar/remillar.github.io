		<h1>NOTORIOUS</h1>
		<p>	THE BRIEF: Become as famous as possible in 30 hours.</p>
 
		<p>Freddy Taylor of KesselsKramer London returned to Edinburgh College of Art graphic design              department to challenge the 2nd and 3rd year students.</p>
 
		<p>In our team of 7 we decided that the easiest way to attract attention would be to create an               illegal event but design the advertising campaign in a way that would be believable. We                  wanted to emphasise the fact that many stories online are believed but are often                        untrue. We chose to create a fake animal fighting event called Exotic Animal                        Showdown.</p>

		<p>We produced posters, pickets and flyers printed onto bright stock and began distributing               them in teams with two cameras following. Crudely made t-shirts with our hashtag also                   featured. We became innundated with emails, tweets and Facebook messages from the public               questioning the show.</p>

		<p>At the end of the 30 hours we had reached over 1500 people. After a few days we decided to             use the page for good - so we explained who we were and apologised if we offended anyone                  on our online accounts. We raised Â£100 on a just giving page to help prevent animal               cruelty around the world.</p>
