		<h1>'Memories Are Made of This'</h1>
		<p>	Memories Are Made of This is an experimental performance at the University of Edinburghâ€™s Talbot Rice Gallery. It is an exploration in sound of The False Memory Archive, an exhibition by artist Alasdair Hopwood. The exhibition including seventy performers from Music in the Community, Edinburgh College of Art Graphic Design students, the University of Edinburgh and children from Hermitage Park Primary School.</p>

		<p>Each agency in Edinburgh College of Art graphic design department were put to the task of designing a poster for the event. My agency, Slice Studio, decided to develop the idea of playful childhood memories and so created a series of posters to reflect this idea.</p>
