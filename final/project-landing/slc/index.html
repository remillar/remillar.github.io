		<h1>South Lanarkshire Council Mental Health and Wellbeing Campaign</h1>
		<p>I completed an internship at South Lanarkshire Council from June to August 2014. During                    this time I became fully integrated into the workings of the Graphic Design Department                  in the Corporate Communications department as a Design Assistant. I worked on larger                    and longer projects than I did during my two week internship in August 2013 and                         learned many new skills in the process.</p>

		<p>In August 2014 South Lanarkshire Council launched their Mental Health and Wellbeing                    campaign. I worked under the art direction of Liz Reid to create visuals which communicated                 to employees and management that the information about mental health was available for                      all to access. We also addressed that the signs of poor mental health are not                               often visible to others.</p>

		<p>The design for the Mental Health and Wellbeing policy reflects the poster campaign and the             transition of an individual with poor mental health to one who is supported and positive                  in their home and working environment.</p>

		<p>Thanks to the SLC graphics department for all their help and a massive thanks to Liz Reid.             </p>
